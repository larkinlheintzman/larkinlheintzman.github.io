## What in Tarnation

Oh i'm taking this horrible site for a spin re blogs n that.

### That a fact?

Yea, some of the most fiddly parts of making this thing were getting .js scripts to work inline (see area below text). There's also the issue of learning how [Jekyll][jekyll-docs] expects things to be done. General theme taken with love from [ThemeFisher][theme-fisher].

<div class="code-container" id="sketch-holder">
  <script src="{{ site.baseurl }}/js/drawieThing.js"></script>
</div>
<!-- <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/p5@1.1.9/lib/p5.js"></script> -->
